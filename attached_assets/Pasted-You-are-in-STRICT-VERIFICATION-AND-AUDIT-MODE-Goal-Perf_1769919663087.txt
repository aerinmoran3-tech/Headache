You are in STRICT VERIFICATION AND AUDIT MODE.

Goal:
Perform a **comprehensive project scan** of the Rental Application Management System, including frontend, backend, database, Edge Functions, and deployment readiness. Your output must be a **fully structured list of remaining tasks** needed to bring the project to production-ready status.

Project Context:
- Frontend: Vanilla JS + HTML
- Backend: Supabase (tables, Edge Functions, RLS)
- Admin panel: fully functional
- Applicant model: authenticated via Supabase Magic Links
- Existing Edge Functions: send-email, update-status
- Centralized status constants in status-map.js
- Deployment target: Netlify
- Current state: SQL migration completed, admin and applicant flows implemented, RLS policies applied

Requirements:
1. Scan the project folder structure, all JS and HTML files, and Supabase functions.
2. Verify frontend:
   - Applicant dashboard login & session management
   - Submission form authentication & validation
   - Dashboard display of applications
   - Real-time updates
   - Integration with status-map.js
   - Admin panel functionality (status updates, admin_notes)
   - Logout, error handling, UX polish
3. Verify backend:
   - Supabase table structure & columns
   - RLS policies for applicants and admins
   - Edge Functions functionality and integration
   - SendGrid integration for email notifications
4. Verify security:
   - Applicants cannot access or modify unauthorized data
   - Admin access correctly restricted and verified
5. Deployment readiness:
   - Environment variables configured
   - Netlify production build checks
6. Generate a **clear, prioritized list** of remaining tasks:
   - Frontend polish (UI/UX, transitions, error messages)
   - Backend enhancements or missing logic
   - Integration fixes
   - Testing and verification steps
7. Output must be **strictly task-based**, with each task numbered and labeled as “Frontend”, “Backend”, “Security”, or “Deployment”.
8. Do not provide explanations or commentary — only actionable tasks.

Deliverable:
- Numbered task list with categories
- Include all remaining items necessary for a fully functional, secure, and production-ready system
