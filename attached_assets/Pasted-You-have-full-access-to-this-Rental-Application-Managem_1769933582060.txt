You have full access to this Rental Application Management System project.

Your task is to perform a FINAL PRODUCTION READINESS VERIFICATION using the checklist below.
Do not assume correctness — confirm each item directly from the codebase, configuration files, and Supabase logic.

For EACH item:
- Mark it as ✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL
- Cite the exact file name(s) and line number(s)
- If FAIL, provide the minimal fix required (do NOT refactor unless necessary)

---------------------------------------
CHECKLIST TO VERIFY
---------------------------------------

1. FILE STRUCTURE & ROUTING
- Confirm public/index.html exists and is the correct entry point
- Confirm admin pages exist under /public/admin/
- Confirm dashboard pages exist under /public/dashboard/
- Confirm no admin JS redirects to index.html or application form
- Confirm all admin redirects use /admin/login.html or /admin/application.html

2. NETLIFY CONFIGURATION
- Verify netlify.toml exists
- Confirm publish directory is "public"
- Confirm admin and dashboard redirect rules exist
- Confirm no global catch-all redirect overrides admin/dashboard routes

3. SUPABASE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
- Verify Supabase keys are NOT hardcoded in any JS files
- Confirm environment variables are referenced correctly
- Identify any dev-only hostname checks that should be removed for production

4. ADMIN AUTH & SECURITY
- Confirm admins table exists
- Confirm admin auth checks validate BOTH:
  a) authenticated session
  b) admin role in database
- Confirm unauthorized users are redirected to /admin/login.html
- Confirm admins are never redirected to the application form

5. RLS & DATABASE SAFETY
- Verify RLS is enabled on applications table
- Confirm applicants can only read their own data
- Confirm admins can read/update all applications
- Confirm storage bucket policies restrict file access properly

6. EDGE FUNCTIONS
- Verify Edge Functions exist and are deployed
- Confirm they use SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Confirm admin validation occurs before write operations
- Confirm explicit JSON responses are returned

7. FRONTEND STABILITY
- Confirm global loading state exists
- Confirm error handling for expired sessions
- Confirm file upload validation exists (type + size)

8. FINAL DEPLOYMENT TEST
- Simulate routing behavior for:
  /
  /dashboard
  /admin/login.html
  /admin/application.html
- Identify any path that incorrectly redirects

---------------------------------------
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
---------------------------------------

SECTION NAME
- Status: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Evidence: (file + line)
- Fix (if needed):

---------------------------------------

DO NOT summarize.
DO NOT generalize.
DO NOT assume Netlify behavior — verify explicitly.

This is a production gate audit.
